Data in this repository has been acquired as part of Nicole Eichert's PhD project at the University of Oxford, which was supervised by Rogier B. Mars and Kate E. Watkins. 

Data in this repository has been used in multiple projects that involved different collaborators. For project-specific acknowledgements, please refer to the relevant references.

Derived data for the publication Eichert et al. 2020 is organized as follows:
- Figure 1C - breathing traces:
* cropped individual breathing traces are stored in `/derivatives/sub-XX/beh/sub-XX_breathing-traces.pkl`. The file can be loaded using Python's pandas package.
* raw data containing subject's breathing traces during the functional scan is stored in `/sub-XX/beh/sub-XX/sub-XX_biopac.mat`

- Figure 2 and Figure 3 - group level fMRI results:
* task: 'ArtVoc' for the basic localizer task and 'Factorial' for the syllable production task
* contrast: lip, tongue, vowel for 'ArtVoc' (Figure 3); vocalization, articulation for 'Factorial' (Figure 2)
* volumetric results in MNI space are stored in `/derivatives/group/func/task/group_task-{task}_{contrast}_zstat1.nii.gz`
* surface count maps are stored in `/derivatives/group/func/task/group_task-{task}_{contrast}_{hemi}_32k_fs_LR.func.gii`

- Figure 4
* average T1w/T2w and thickness maps are stored in `/derivatives/group/anat`
* averate mpm maps are stored in `/derivatives/group/mpm`
* individual surface maps are stored in `derivatives/sub-XX/anat` and `derivatives/sub-XX/mpm`

- Figure 5
* numerical values underlying the figures are stored as csv-files in `/derivatives/group/mpm/`

- Surface files for display of surface maps
* average inflated surfaces are stored in `/derivatives/group/anat/group.{hemi}.inflated.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii` (and 164k)
* individual native midthickness surfaces are stored in `/derivatives/sub-XX/anat/sub-XX.{hemi}.midthickness.native.surf.gii`
