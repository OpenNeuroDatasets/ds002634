- not all scripts in the related code repositories run directly on the OpenNeuro dataset because it does not contain all intermediate data

- all missing intermediate data can, in principle, be reconstructed using the provided code, but file paths might have to be adapted

- the first 25 volumes of all individual bold task scans need to be discarded prior to analysis. These volumes were acquired during the time, where noise-cancelling headphones 'learned' the scanner noise
- the fieldmap for subject 11 can only be applied to the 'ArtVoc' bold task scan and not to the 'Factorial' bold task scan
- average inflated surfaces are stored in `/derivatives/group/anat/group.{hemi}.inflated.32k_fs_LR.surf.gii` (and 164k)
- individual native midthickness surfaces are stored in `/derivatives/sub-{sub}/anat/sub-{sub}.{hemi}.midthickness.native.surf.gii`

- Figure 1C - breathing traces:
    - cropped individual breathing traces are stored in `/derivatives/sub-{sub}/beh/sub-{sub}_breathing-traces.pkl`. The file can be loaded using Python's pandas package.
    - raw data containing subject's breathing traces during the functional scan is stored in `/sub-{sub}/beh/sub-{sub}/sub-{sub}_biopac.mat`

- Figure 2 and Figure 3 - group level fMRI results:
    - task: 'ArtVoc' for the basic localizer task and 'Factorial' for the syllable production task
    - contrast: lip, tongue, vowel for 'ArtVoc' (Figure 3); vocalization, articulation for 'Factorial' (Figure 2)
    - volumetric results in MNI space are stored in `/derivatives/group/func/task/group_task-{task}_{contrast}_zstat1.nii.gz`
    - surface count maps are stored in `/derivatives/group/func/task/group_task-{task}_{contrast}_{hemi}_32k_fs_LR.func.gii`

- Figure 4 - surface metrics
    - average T1w/T2w and thickness maps are stored in `/derivatives/group/anat`
    - averate mpm maps are stored in `/derivatives/group/mpm`
    - individual surface maps are stored in `derivatives/sub-{sub}/anat` and `derivatives/sub-{sub}/mpm`

- Figure 5 - quantitative analysis
    - numerical values underlying the figures are stored as csv-files in `/derivatives/group/mpm/*csv`
